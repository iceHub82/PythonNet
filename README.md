## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to call Python scripts from a .NET 9 Razor Pages web application, using the recently published [CSnakes](https://github.com/tonybaloney/CSnakes) library to enable Python execution within .NET.

### Solution Details

- The application is built on .NET 9 Razor Pages and integrates with **CSnakes**, allowing seamless Python script execution within .NET.
- A minimal API endpoint is used, together with **HTMX**, to call Python scripts and return dynamically generated stock graph images (PNG format) using the **matplotlib** and **pandas** libraries in Python.

### Setup Instructions

Upon initial project startup, a Python virtual environment will be created, and required packages will be installed automatically. This process may take a few moments, with progress visible in the console output.
