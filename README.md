The project was created to see if it was possible to call python scripts from a Razor pages web application.
Solution consists of .Net 9 Razor pages application + with the newly created project https://github.com/tonybaloney/CSnakes that makes it possible to run python in .Net.
To demonstrate the application calls python via minimalapi with HTMX that returns a stock graph png generated by the python library matplotlib in the backend.

When the project first starts up, the python virtual environment needs to be created and packages installed. That can take a short while. Python installation process is logged in the console app.
